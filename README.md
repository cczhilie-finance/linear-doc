# Linear Documentation

This repository contains **_internal_** documentation for the Linear Finance platform. It's meant to help readers understand how the entire system operates both from a high-level perspective, as well as down to the technical details of how things _actually_ work. Hopefully, it contains enough information and instruction for someone with sufficient access to code to deploy a new instance of the entire system if he/she wishes so.
